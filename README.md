# LeaderboardList-app
In this activity I will set up a JavaScript project for the Leaderboard list app, using webpack and ES6 features (modules). I will develop a first working version of the app following a wireframe (without styling) - just functionality. In following activities, I will consume the Leaderboard API using JavaScript async and await and add some styling.
